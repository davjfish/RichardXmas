%Still through the cloven skies they come
%With peaceful wings unfurled
%And still their heavenly music floats
%O'er all the weary world
%Above its sad and lowly plains
%They bend on hovering wing
%And ever oer its Babel sounds
%The blessed angels sing
%
%3
%All ye beneath life's crushing load
%Whose forms are bending low
%Who toil along the climbing way
%With painful steps and slow
%Look now for glad and golden hours
%Come swiftly on the wing
%O rest beside the weary road
%And hear the angels sing
%
%4
%For lo the days are hastening on
%by prophets seen of old
%When with the ever circling years
%shall come the time foretold
%When the new heaven and earth
%shall own the prince of peace their King
%And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing.
