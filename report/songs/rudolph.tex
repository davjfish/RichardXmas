\beginverse
\[G]Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny \[D7]nose
\[D7]And if you ever saw it
You would even say it \[G]glows
\[G]All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him \[D7]names
\[D7]They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer \[G]games
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]Then one foggy \[E7]Christmas Eve
\[Am7]Santa \[D]came to \[G]say
\[D7]Rudolph, with your nose so bright
\[A7]Won't you guide my \[D7]sleigh tonight?
\endverse

\beginverse
\[G]Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with \[D7]glee
\[D7]Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in \[G]history.
\endverse
